# Parallex-Effect
The goal of this project is to design and develop visually stunning web pages using the CSS parallax effect. The parallax effect is a popular technique that creates an illusion of depth and adds a sense of interactivity to web pages.

In this project, we will leverage HTML and CSS to implement the parallax effect. The web pages will consist of multiple layers of content, such as images, text, and other visual elements, arranged in a visually appealing manner. As the user scrolls through the page, these layers will move at different speeds, creating a dynamic and immersive effect.
